							<p id="aboutMeText">I recently moved to Gilbert, Arizona earlier this year. I grew up in Southern California and graduated with a Business Degree from Concordia University, Irivne. My first job out of college was a technical recruiting position in which I placed Microsoft .NET Developers in the Orange County market. From there I relocated within the company to Los Angeles and placed Front-End, JavaScript, PHP, Python and Ruby Engineers. <br><br>

							<p id="secondP">		During my time as a recruiter I learned a lot about technology and software development, but from more of a conceptual standpoint. For instance, I knew that JQuery and Bootstrap were libraries, but I never actually did any hands on coding. All in all, I talked to an upwards of 50 software developers on a weekly basis, and learned an awful lot about the software development industry. I couldn't help but wonder what it would be like to be on the other side of the fence and actually be someone who worked with cutting edge technologies and building interesting applications.</p><br>
							
							<p id="thirdP">Flashfoward to now, and I am incredibly excited to be in this web development bootcamp through the University of Arizona. I am excited to learn more about web technologies, especially JavaScript and the various associated frameworks and libraries. I am eager to get into application development and get into backend development.</p>
